The Killers - Boy

-Just give yourself some time-

Head down
Wrong fit
Big deal
That’s just growing up
Untouched
Sixteen
Don’t overthink it, boy
White arrows will break the black night
But don’t overthink it, boy

White arrows will break the black night
But don’t overthink it, boy

And when you’re out on the ledge
Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time
Drawn arrows unseen will fly

Heatwave
Slow lane
Small town
Only diesels dance
These streets
Weren’t meant to house
Jet-fueled engine dreams
White arrows will blast the black night

And when you’re out on the ledge
Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time
Home drawn arrows unseen will fly
And break the black night

But don’t overthink it, boy
