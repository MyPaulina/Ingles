Come and Get Your Love


Hey (hey) what's the matter with your head, yeah
Hey (hey) what's the matter with your mind and your sign and oh
Hey (hey) nothin' the matter with your head
Baby, find it, come on and find it
Bear with it, baby, 'cause you're fine
And you're mine, and you look so divine
Come and get your love
