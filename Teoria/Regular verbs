Regular verbs


Regular verbs make up the majority of verbs used in English.
They are verbs that can be conjugated without changing the stem. 
When conjugated in the present or future tense, they are unchanged. 
When conjugated in the past tense, some rules apply for adding endings or suffixes.


One of the most commonly used rules for conjugating most regular verbs 
in the past tense is to add the ending -ED at the end. As with all rules, 
there are always some exceptions when conjugating.


Depending on how the verb ends, the number of vowels intercalated with consonants at the end, 
the type of consonant it ends with, the suffix or ending that must be placed at the end to give it 
the correct conjugation will vary.
